Ahead of me I have all night,
With lemon I shall have my tea.
My screen is the sole source of light
It's bright and sharp, it hurts to see.
On GitHub I am reading thus
The things that you built in D3.
Going down through your deltas, plus
The numbers, numbers you commit.
The minutes I will scan across
At least the hours I omit...
These snapshots of your code do show
Some glimpses of your mind and whit.
Maybe I should just say "Hello,"
And ask "Do you remember me?"
And after that, add apropos
"Come solve some puzzles here, with me!"
