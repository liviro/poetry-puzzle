Ahead of me I have all night,
With Frangelico I spike my tea.
My screen is the sole source of light
But I think that's okay with me.
On GitHub I am reading thus
The things that you built in D3.
Going down through your deltas, plus
The numbers that hide in your commit.
The minutes I will make my truss
And go through them, bit after bit.
These snapshots of your code do show
Some glimpses of your mind and whit.
Maybe I should just say "Hello,"
"I'm almost done with my degree!"
And after that, add apropos
"Come solve some puzzles here, with me!"
