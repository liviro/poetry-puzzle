Poetry Puzzle
=============

Note: this README's addition to the repo and its subsequent changes are **not** part of the puzzle.

All, if any, mistakes and choices are intentional.

Figuring out the rules is part of the game.

More straighforward if not done via GitHub's website, due to certain ways it chooses to display some things.

Good luck!
